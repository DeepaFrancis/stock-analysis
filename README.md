# *Stock Analysis*
*Overview of Project*
*In this project, we are analyzing some stocks data. Steve’s parents are passionate about green energy and want to invest in green energy stocks. We are helping him to automate and analyze the data with VBA code. We have refactored the code to loop through all the data one time in order to make the code faster.*

## *Purpose*
*The challenge project’s purpose is to refactor the code to improve performance of the Stock Analysis code. By refactoring the code, we want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.*
*By refactoring we update or improve the internal structure of the code before it becomes messy and create any problem in the future. We restructure the code without changing the external behavior or functionality of the application.*

### *Analysis*

*The following screenshots gives us the comparison of the performance speed of the code after refactoring.*

## *Results*

*The code refactoring has improved the performance speed. It takes less than half of the time for running the refratured code.*

### *What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?*

*Some advantages of refactoring of Code:*
- *Refactoring code is not rewriting code. Rewriting code changes the behavior of the code but refactoring doesn't. For customer's code refactoring doesn't matter at all.*
- *The main idea behind code refactoring is making the inefficient and over-complicated code to more efficient, simpler, cleaner, and easier to understand.* 
- *Code refactoring makes the entire application more efficient, secure, fast, maintainable, and scalable.*
- *It also helps developers to find the hidden bugs and vulnerabilities in the system.*

*Some disadvantages of the refactoring of code :*
- *It is expensive and risky in the view of management.*
- *It may introduce bugs.*
- *Delivery schedule is very tight.*
- *Management doesn't care about maintainability and extension of code base.*

*Code Refactoring has to be skipped in the following cases.*
- *Delivery Deadline is near and new development is planned.*
- *The cost of refactoring is higher than rewriting the code from scratch.*
- *Don't refactor the code if you don't have the time to test the refactored code before release. It can introduce bugs.*
- *Don't do delayed refactoring because it contains a big mess and makes it very difficult to refactor. Do early refactoring.*
- *Stable code should not be refactored.*



### *How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?*
*Code refactoring makes the entire application more efficient, secure and fast.*
*It's making the code maintainable.*
